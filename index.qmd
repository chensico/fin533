## Best Trade Case Analysis

::: {.card}
### Market Context
On March 21, 2025, AAPL stock had been experiencing a short-term pullback, with the price dropping from about $230 to $222 over several sessions. The RSI indicator had fallen to 28, well below our threshold of 35, indicating an oversold condition.

### Entry and Exit Details
- **Entry Date**: March 21, 2025
- **Entry Price**: $221.88
- **RSI at Entry**: 28
- **Stop Loss**: $218.58 (ATR × 1.5)
- **Take Profit**: $230.78 (ATR × 3.0)
- **Exit Date**: March 22, 2025
- **Exit Price**: $224.20
- **Exit Reason**: Price below SMA50
- **Profit/Loss**: $2.32 (1.05% return)

### Success Factors
This trade capitalized on a quick price bounce from support level. The relatively low RSI (28) indicated an oversold condition, making the entry timing optimal. While the trade didn't reach the take profit target, it still yielded a positive return before the exit signal triggered.

### Strategy Visualization {.center}

![Trading Strategy Visualization](AAPL_trading_signals.png)

*Figure 1: Trading signals with price and RSI indicators. The upper panel shows AAPL price over 12 months with key indicators (SMA20, SMA50, SMA200) and Bollinger Bands. Buy signals (green triangles) appear mostly in 2025-Q1 when RSI drops below 35 and price nears the lower Bollinger Band. The lower panel shows RSI with buy signals in the oversold area (below 40). Most positions exit quickly (red triangles) when price drops below SMA50.*

![Portfolio Performance](AAPL_portfolio_performance.png)

*Figure 2: Portfolio value, drawdown and monthly returns. The top panel shows portfolio value staying near $100,000 with minimal changes despite several trades. The middle panel shows drawdowns with a maximum of -0.15% in April 2025, matching the largest losing trade. The bottom panel shows monthly returns - mostly neutral (green) with some underperformance (red) in April 2025.*

![Trade Analysis](AAPL_trade_analysis.png)

*Figure 3: Trade distribution charts. The top-left shows profit distribution of six trades, with one major loss around -$145. The top-right shows returns from -7% to +2%. The bottom-left confirms all trades lasted exactly 1 day due to our quick exit rules. The bottom-right plots duration against return - no correlation exists as all trades had the same duration.*

![Advanced Metrics Analysis](advanced_metrics_analysis.png)

*Figure 4: Advanced risk and return metrics. Daily returns (top-left) cluster around zero with few outliers. The drawdown chart (top-right) shows the portfolio stayed mostly at zero drawdown, except for one -0.15% event. Rolling returns and volatility (bottom-left) show increased volatility in March-April 2025 along with falling returns. The Sharpe ratio (bottom-right) was positive early but turned negative in the final month during the largest losing trade.*

![Parameter Optimization Results](parameter_optimization_results.png)

*Figure 5: Parameter testing results. The Sharpe ratio heatmap (top-left) shows RSI=35 performs best across all ATR stop values, with -0.83 being the least negative Sharpe ratio. The scatter plot (top-right) shows how parameters affect returns (color) and win rates (point size). The correlation matrix (bottom-left) shows RSI threshold has strong negative correlation (-0.87) with performance. The risk-return chart (bottom-right) highlights the best combination with low risk (0.15% max drawdown) but still negative return (-0.13%).*
