The lower panel shows RSI with clear oversold areas (below 40) and overbought areas (above 70), with frequent trading activity occurring as RSI oscillates between these zones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortfolio Performance\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Portfolio value, drawdown and monthly returns. The top panel shows portfolio value growing from $100,000 to $112,885 with green (buy) and red (sell) triangles marking all trades. The middle panel shows drawdowns with a maximum of -2.37% in July 2024, clearly marked with a red star.

The top-left shows profit distribution with most trades clustered around smaller profits and a few exceptional trades exceeding $2,000-$4,000. The top-right shows percentage returns distribution with a positive skew. The bottom-left histogram reveals the majority of trades had a duration of just 1 day, with smaller clusters at 3 and 4 days. The bottom-right scatter plot shows that the highest returns (including the standout 15% return) occurred on 1-day trades, supporting our quick-exit approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Context\nOn April 8, 2025, AAPL stock had been experiencing a significant decline, falling to the $172 range from previous levels above $200. The RSI indicator had fallen to 20, extremely below our threshold of 35, indicating a deeply oversold condition. The price was -5.9% from the lower Bollinger Band, showing exceptional bearish deviation.\n\n\nEntry and Exit Details\n\nEntry Date: April 8, 2025\nEntry Price: $172.06\nRSI at Entry: 20\nBB Status: -5.9% from BB Lower\nStop Loss: $167.46 (ATR × 2.0)\nTake Profit: $189.86 (ATR × 5.0)\nExit Date: April 9, 2025\nExit Price: $198.85\nExit Reason: SMA Breakdown\nProfit/Loss: $4160.32 (15.57% return)\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors\nThis trade capitalized on a strong bullish reversal after a steep decline. The extremely low RSI (20) indicated a deeply oversold condition, making the entry timing optimal. The price moved rapidly upward the next day, well beyond the take profit target, demonstrating the effectiveness of the strategy in capturing rebounds from oversold levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trade blotter shows a selection of the most significant trades from our 222 total trades over the testing period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntry Date\nExit Date\nDays\nEntry Price\nExit Price\nShares\nProfit/Loss\nReturn\nExit Reason\n\n\n\n\n2025-04-08\n2025-04-09\n1\n$172.06\n$198.85\n155\n$4160.32\n15.57%\nSMA_Breakdown\n\n\n2025-04-10\n2025-04-11\n1\n$186.10\n$198.15\n149\n$1797.46\n6.48%\nSMA_Breakdown\n\n\n2024-06-10\n2024-06-11\n1\n$193.69\n$207.15\n131\n$1771.77\n6.95%\nRSI_Overbought\n\n\n2024-08-02\n2024-08-05\n3\n$199.09\n$209.27\n127\n$1298.92\n5.11%\nSMA_Breakdown\n\n\n2025-03-07\n2025-03-10\n3\n$235.54\n$227.48\n114\n-$924.44\n-3.42%\nSMA_Breakdown\n\n\n2024-02-01\n2024-02-02\n1\n$179.87\n$185.85\n142\n$851.60\n3.32%\nSMA_Breakdown\n\n\n2025-01-27\n2025-01-28\n1\n$230.84\n$238.26\n115\n$854.12\n3.21%\nSMA_Breakdown\n\n\n2024-07-31\n2024-08-01\n1\n$224.37\n$218.36\n113\n-$685.03\n-2.68%\nUnknown\n\n\n2024-07-17\n2024-07-18\n1\n$230.14\n$224.18\n113\n-$673.86\n-2.59%\nUnknown\n\n\n2024-08-30\n2024-09-03\n4\n$228.55\n$222.77\n114\n-$660.02\n-2.53%\nUnknown\n\n\n\nThe blotter analysis shows a mix of high-profit and high-loss trades.

    "text": "Detailed Strategy Implementation\n\nCore Trading Logic\nThe “Buy Low Sell High” strategy is designed to identify temporary price dips in uptrending markets, entering long positions when prices are oversold according to technical indicators, and exiting based on predefined conditions.\n\nEntry Conditions\nFor a trade entry signal to be generated, ALL of the following conditions must be met simultaneously:\n\nConfirmed Uptrend: The 50-day Simple Moving Average must be above the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA50 &gt; SMA200), indicating an overall bullish market structure.\nOversold Condition: The 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI) must fall below the optimized threshold value (35 in our optimal configuration), indicating a temporary oversold condition.\nPrice at Support: The closing price must touch or fall below the lower Bollinger Band (20-period, 2 standard deviations), confirming price is at a statistical support level.\n\nWhen all three conditions are satisfied, the system: - Generates a BUY signal - Sets entry price at the current closing price - Calculates position size at 2% of the portfolio value - Establishes dynamic stop-loss and take-profit levels based on the Average True Range (ATR)\n# Entry logic from generate_signals() function\nif (df_signals.iloc[i]['SMA50'] &gt; df_signals.iloc[i]['SMA200'] and\n    df_signals.iloc[i]['RSI'] &lt; rsi_threshold and\n    df_signals.iloc[i]['Close'] &lt;= df_signals.iloc[i]['BB_Lower']):\n    # Generate buy signal and set parameters\n    entry_price = df_signals.iloc[i]['Close']\n    atr_value = df_signals.iloc[i]['ATR']\n    df_signals.iloc[i, df_signals.columns.get_loc('Signal')] = 1\n    df_signals.iloc[i, df_signals.columns.get_loc('Stop_Loss')] = entry_price - 2.0 * atr_value\n    df_signals.iloc[i, df_signals.columns.get_loc('Take_Profit')] = entry_price + 5.0 * atr_value\n\n\nExit Conditions\nThe strategy exits an open position when ANY of the following conditions occur:\n\nRSI Overbought: If RSI rises above 70, indicating the asset has become overbought.\nStop-Loss Triggered: If price falls below the calculated stop-loss level (Entry Price - ATR × Stop Multiplier).\nTake-Profit Triggered: If price rises above the calculated take-profit level (Entry Price + ATR × Take Multiplier).\nTrend Reversal: If price closes below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA50), suggesting the shorter-term trend may be reversing.\n\n# Exit logic from generate_signals() function\nif df_signals.iloc[i]['Signal'] == 1 and df_signals.iloc[i]['RSI'] &gt; 70:\n    df_signals.iloc[i, df_signals.columns.get_loc('Signal')] = 0\n    # Exit: RSI overbought\nelif df_signals.iloc[i]['Signal'] == 1 and df_signals.iloc[i]['Low'] &lt;= df_signals.iloc[i]['Stop_Loss']:\n    df_signals.iloc[i, df_signals.columns.get_loc('Signal')] = 0\n    # Exit: Stop-loss triggered\nelif df_signals.iloc[i]['Signal'] == 1 and df_signals.iloc[i]['High'] &gt;= df_signals.iloc[i]['Take_Profit']:\n    df_signals.iloc[i, df_signals.columns.get_loc('Signal')] = 0\n    # Exit: Take-profit triggered\nelif df_signals.iloc[i]['Signal'] == 1 and df_signals.iloc[i]['Close'] &lt; df_signals.iloc[i]['SMA50']:\n    df_signals.iloc[i, df_signals.columns.get_loc('Signal')] = 0\n    # Exit: Close below SMA50\n\n\nPosition Sizing and Risk Management\n\nFixed Risk Percentage: Each trade risks 2% of the portfolio value (Position_Size = 0.02)\nDynamic Stop-Loss: Calculated using ATR to adapt to market volatility (Stop_Loss = Entry_Price - ATR × Stop_Multiplier)\nAsymmetric Reward-Risk Ratio: Take-profit level is set at a multiple of the stop-loss distance (optimal parameters found: 2.0× ATR for stop-loss, 5.0× ATR for take-profit, resulting in a 2.5:1 reward-to-risk ratio)\n\n\n\nParameter Optimization Process\nThe strategy employs grid-search optimization across three key parameters: - RSI Threshold: Tested values of 30, 35, 40, and 45 - ATR Stop Multiplier: Tested values of 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 - ATR Take Multiplier: Tested values of 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0\nEach parameter combination is evaluated based on: - Sharpe Ratio (primary optimization metric) - Total Return - Maximum Drawdown - Win Rate - Number of Trades\nThe optimal parameter combination (RSI=35, Stop=2.0×ATR, Take=5.0×ATR) was selected based on maximizing the Sharpe Ratio, which balances return against risk."
