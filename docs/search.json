    "text": "Best Trade Case Analysis\nLet’s analyze the most profitable trade from our backtest to understand the dynamics of a successful signal:\nAAPL Trade (March 13-14, 2025)\nMarket Context: - AAPL had been in a downtrend, dropping from $227.48 on March 10th to $209.68 on March 13th - RSI fell below our threshold, indicating oversold conditions - Price approached the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting potential support\nEntry Details: - Date: March 13, 2025 - Entry Price: $209.68 - RSI at Entry: 36.9 (below our threshold of 40) - Position Size: 2% of portfolio (approximately $2,000) - Stop Loss: Set at $205.18 (Entry - 1.5× ATR) - Take Profit: Set at $218.68 (Entry + 3.0× ATR)\nExit Details: - Date: March 14, 2025 - Exit Price: $213.49 - Exit Reason: Close below SMA50 (trend reversal signal) - Holding Period: 1 day\nTrade Outcome: - Profit: +$36.33 - Return: +1.82% - Risk-Reward: Favorable, exited before reaching take-profit level but captured upside\nKey Success Factors: - Entry at relatively oversold levels - Quick price bounce from support level - Proper position sizing limiting exposure - Disciplined exit when trend signal reversed\nThis trade demonstrates that even in a challenging overall market environment, the strategy can identify short-term reversal opportunities. The short holding period is typical of the backtest results, where most positions were closed quickly due to SMA crossovers."
