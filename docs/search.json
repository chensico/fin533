    "text": "Best Trade Case Analysis\nLet’s analyze the most profitable trade from our backtest to understand the dynamics of a successful signal:\nAAPL Trade (March 13-14, 2025)\nMarket Context: - AAPL had been in a downtrend, dropping from $227.48 on March 10th to $209.68 on March 13th - RSI fell below our threshold, indicating oversold conditions - Price approached the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting potential support\nEntry Details: - Date: March 13, 2025 - Entry Price: $209.68 - RSI at Entry: 36.9 (below our threshold of 40) - Position Size: 2% of portfolio (approximately $2,000) - Stop Loss: Set at $205.18 (Entry - 1.5× ATR) - Take Profit: Set at $218.68 (Entry + 3.0× ATR)\nExit Details: - Date: March 14, 2025 - Exit Price: $213.49 - Exit Reason: Close below SMA50 (trend reversal signal) - Holding Period: 1 day\nTrade Outcome: - Profit: +$36.33 - Return: +1.82% - Risk-Reward: Favorable, exited before reaching take-profit level but captured upside\nKey Success Factors: - Entry at relatively oversold levels - Quick price bounce from support level - Proper position sizing limiting exposure - Disciplined exit when trend signal reversed\nThis trade demonstrates that even in a challenging overall market environment, the strategy can identify short-term reversal opportunities. The short holding period is typical of the backtest results, where most positions were closed quickly due to SMA crossovers."

The upper panel shows AAPL price over 12 months with key indicators (SMA20, SMA50, SMA200) and Bollinger Bands. Buy signals (green triangles) appear mostly in 2025-Q1 when RSI drops below 35 and price nears the lower Bollinger Band. The lower panel shows RSI with buy signals in the oversold area (below 40). Most positions exit quickly (red triangles) when price drops below SMA50.\n\n\n\nPortfolio Performance\n\n\nFigure 2: Portfolio value, drawdown and monthly returns. The top panel shows portfolio value staying near $100,000 with minimal changes despite several trades. The middle panel shows drawdowns with a maximum of -0.15% in April 2025, matching the largest losing trade. The bottom panel shows monthly returns - mostly neutral (green) with some underperformance (red) in April 2025.\n\n\n\nTrade Analysis\n\n\nFigure 3: Trade distribution charts. The top-left shows profit distribution of six trades, with one major loss around -$145. The top-right shows returns from -7% to +2%. The bottom-left confirms all trades lasted exactly 1 day due to our quick exit rules. The bottom-right plots duration against return - no correlation exists as all trades had the same duration.\nAdvanced Metrics:\n\n\n\nAdvanced Metrics Analysis\n\n\nFigure 4: Advanced risk and return metrics. Daily returns (top-left) cluster around zero with few outliers. The drawdown chart (top-right) shows the portfolio stayed mostly at zero drawdown, except for one -0.15% event. Rolling returns and volatility (bottom-left) show increased volatility in March-April 2025 along with falling returns. The Sharpe ratio (bottom-right) was positive early but turned negative in the final month during the largest losing trade.\nParameter Optimization Results:\n\n\n\nParameter Optimization Results\n\n\nFigure 5: Parameter testing results.
