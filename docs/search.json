The RSI indicator had fallen to 28, well below our threshold of 35, indicating an oversold condition.\n\n\nEntry and Exit Details\n\nEntry Date: March 21, 2025\nEntry Price: $221.88\nRSI at Entry: 28\nStop Loss: $218.58 (ATR × 1.5)\nTake Profit: $230.78 (ATR × 3.0)\nExit Date: March 22, 2025\nExit Price: $224.20\nExit Reason: Price below SMA50\nProfit/Loss: $2.32 (1.05% return)\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors\nThis trade capitalized on a quick price bounce from support level. The relatively low RSI (28) indicated an oversold condition, making the entry timing optimal. While the trade didn’t reach the take profit target, it still yielded a positive return before the exit signal triggered."
