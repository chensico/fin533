## Our Trading Philosophy

Our research is based on a key market principle: **prices typically return to their average after extreme movements**. Our "Buy Low / Sell High" strategy captures these reversion opportunities using a structured, evidence-based approach.

### Market Inefficiencies We Target

Our strategy takes advantage of two common market patterns:

1. **Overreaction to News**: Markets often overreact to short-term negative news, creating buying opportunities in fundamentally strong assets.

2. **Support Level Bounces**: Prices frequently rebound when they reach statistical support levels (such as Bollinger Bands) during uptrends.

## Strategy Framework

Instead of explaining every technical detail (available in our [main analysis](index.html)), we present the core concepts:

### The Three Entry Conditions

Our strategy only enters a position when all three conditions are met:

- **Confirmed Uptrend**: We only buy when the market trend is clearly positive
- **Oversold Indicators**: We require technical evidence of oversold conditions
- **Price at Support**: We need confirmation that price has reached a support level

### The Four Exit Signals

Our disciplined exit approach responds to any of these market signals:

- **Target Reached**: The asset has become overbought
- **Stop Loss Hit**: The price has fallen below our predefined risk level
- **Take Profit Triggered**: The price has reached our profit target
- **Trend Reversal**: The short-term trend direction has changed

## Implementation Details

For those interested in the technical aspects, here is a simplified explanation:

### Technical Indicators
- **Moving Averages**: 50-day and 200-day SMAs confirm trend direction
- **RSI**: 14-period Relative Strength Index identifies oversold conditions
- **Bollinger Bands**: 20-period with 2 standard deviations marks statistical extremes
- **ATR**: 14-period Average True Range enables dynamic risk management

### Entry Logic
The system generates a BUY signal when ALL these conditions are met:
```
IF (SMA50 > SMA200) AND (RSI < 35) AND (Price <= Lower Bollinger Band) THEN BUY
```

### Exit Logic
The system generates a SELL signal when ANY of these conditions occur:
```
IF (RSI > 70) OR (Price < Stop Loss) OR (Price > Take Profit) OR (Price < SMA50) THEN SELL
```

### Risk Management
- Position Size: 2% of portfolio per trade
- Stop Loss: Entry Price - (1.5 × ATR)
- Take Profit: Entry Price + (3.0 × ATR)

### Optimization Results
After extensive testing, our best parameter combination achieved:
- 50% Win Rate
- -0.13% Total Return (during test period)
- 0.15% Maximum Drawdown
- -0.83 Sharpe Ratio (highest among all tested combinations)

Although the overall return was slightly negative during our test period, the strategy showed excellent risk control with minimal drawdown, providing a solid foundation for further development.

## Best Market Conditions

Our backtesting shows this strategy works best in:

- **Range-bound markets** with definite technical boundaries
- **Bullish markets** with regular pullbacks
- **Low-volatility environments** with measured price movements

The strategy adapts to changing market conditions through its ATR-based parameters, automatically adjusting position size and risk levels as volatility changes.

## About the Team

**Sicong Chen** specializes in quantitative strategy development with expertise in technical analysis and market microstructure. His research focuses on mean-reversion strategies and statistical arbitrage.

**Yuxin Wan** brings expertise in risk modeling and portfolio optimization. Her work focuses on robust backtesting methods and testing parameter stability across different market conditions.

Together, we combine technical analysis with statistical methods to create trading strategies that perform consistently in changing market environments.

## Beyond the Backtests

While our [detailed analysis](index.html) provides complete performance metrics, we understand that successful strategy implementation requires more than just good backtest results:

- **Psychological Factors**: The 50% win rate and small drawdowns make this strategy psychologically manageable for most traders.

- **Simple Execution**: With clear rules and typically 1-day holding periods, this strategy is straightforward to implement.

- **Diversification Potential**: This approach can be applied to multiple assets and timeframes for portfolio diversification.

- **Learning Value**: The strategy demonstrates fundamental market principles, making it valuable for education purposes.
