## Our Trading Philosophy

Our research is based on a key market principle: **prices typically return to their average after extreme movements**. Our "Buy Low / Sell High" strategy captures these reversion opportunities using a structured, evidence-based approach.

### Market Inefficiencies We Target

Our strategy takes advantage of two common market patterns:

1. **Overreaction to News**: Markets often overreact to short-term negative news, creating buying opportunities in fundamentally strong assets.

2. **Support Level Bounces**: Prices frequently rebound when they reach statistical support levels (such as Bollinger Bands) during uptrends.

## Strategy Framework

Instead of explaining every technical detail (available in our [main analysis](index.html)), we present the core concepts:

### The Three Entry Conditions

Our strategy only enters a position when all three conditions are met:

- **Confirmed Uptrend**: We only buy when the market trend is clearly positive
- **Oversold Indicators**: We require technical evidence of oversold conditions
- **Price at Support**: We need confirmation that price has reached a support level

### The Four Exit Signals

Our disciplined exit approach responds to any of these market signals:

- **Target Reached**: The asset has become overbought
- **Stop Loss Hit**: The price has fallen below our predefined risk level
- **Take Profit Triggered**: The price has reached our profit target
- **Trend Reversal**: The short-term trend direction has changed

## Implementation Details

For those interested in the technical aspects, here is a simplified explanation:

### Technical Indicators
- **Moving Averages**: 50-day and 200-day SMAs confirm trend direction
- **RSI**: 14-period Relative Strength Index identifies oversold conditions
- **Bollinger Bands**: 20-period with 2 standard deviations marks statistical extremes
- **ATR**: 14-period Average True Range enables dynamic risk management

### Entry Logic
The system generates a BUY signal when ALL these conditions are met:
```
IF (SMA50 > SMA200) AND (RSI < 35) AND (Price <= Lower Bollinger Band) THEN BUY
```

### Exit Logic
The system generates a SELL signal when ANY of these conditions occur:
```
IF (RSI > 70) OR (Price < Stop Loss) OR (Price > Take Profit) OR (Price < SMA50) THEN SELL
```

### Risk Management
- Position Size: 2% of portfolio per trade
- Stop Loss: Entry Price - (2.0 × ATR)
- Take Profit: Entry Price + (5.0 × ATR)

### Optimization Results
After extensive testing, our best parameter combination achieved:
- 55.41% Win Rate
- 12.88% Total Return (during test period)
- 2.37% Maximum Drawdown
- 0.95 Sharpe Ratio (highest among all tested combinations)

The strategy showed excellent performance with minimal drawdown, providing a solid foundation for further development.

## Best Market Conditions

Our backtesting shows this strategy works best in:

- **Range-bound markets** with definite technical boundaries
- **Bullish markets** with regular pullbacks
- **Low-volatility environments** with measured price movements

The strategy adapts to changing market conditions through its ATR-based parameters, automatically adjusting position size and risk levels as volatility changes.

## About the Team

**Sicong Chen** specializes in quantitative strategy development with expertise in technical analysis and market microstructure. His research focuses on mean-reversion strategies and statistical arbitrage.

**Yuxin Wan** brings expertise in risk modeling and portfolio optimization. Her work focuses on robust backtesting methods and testing parameter stability across different market conditions.

Together, we combine technical analysis with statistical methods to create trading strategies that perform consistently in changing market environments.

## Beyond the Backtests

While our [detailed analysis](index.html) provides complete performance metrics, we understand that successful strategy implementation requires more than just good backtest results:

- **Psychological Factors**: The 55.41% win rate and small drawdowns make this strategy psychologically manageable for most traders.

- **Simple Execution**: With clear rules and typically 1-day holding periods, this strategy is straightforward to implement.

- **Diversification Potential**: This approach can be applied to multiple assets and timeframes for portfolio diversification.

- **Learning Value**: The strategy demonstrates fundamental market principles, making it valuable for education purposes.

## Detailed Strategy Implementation

### Core Trading Logic
The "Buy Low Sell High" strategy is designed to identify temporary price dips in uptrending markets, entering long positions when prices are oversold according to technical indicators, and exiting based on predefined conditions.

#### Entry Conditions
For a trade entry signal to be generated, ALL of the following conditions must be met simultaneously:

1. **Confirmed Uptrend**: The 50-day Simple Moving Average must be above the 200-day Simple Moving Average (`SMA50 > SMA200`), indicating an overall bullish market structure.

2. **Oversold Condition**: The 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI) must fall below the optimized threshold value (35 in our optimal configuration), indicating a temporary oversold condition.

3. **Price at Support**: The closing price must touch or fall below the lower Bollinger Band (20-period, 2 standard deviations), confirming price is at a statistical support level.

When all three conditions are satisfied, the system:
- Generates a BUY signal
- Sets entry price at the current closing price
- Calculates position size at 2% of the portfolio value
- Establishes dynamic stop-loss and take-profit levels based on the Average True Range (ATR)

```python
# Entry logic from generate_signals() function
if (df_signals.iloc[i]['SMA50'] > df_signals.iloc[i]['SMA200'] and
    df_signals.iloc[i]['RSI'] < rsi_threshold and
    df_signals.iloc[i]['Close'] <= df_signals.iloc[i]['BB_Lower']):
    # Generate buy signal and set parameters
    entry_price = df_signals.iloc[i]['Close']
    atr_value = df_signals.iloc[i]['ATR']
    df_signals.iloc[i, df_signals.columns.get_loc('Signal')] = 1
    df_signals.iloc[i, df_signals.columns.get_loc('Stop_Loss')] = entry_price - 2.0 * atr_value
    df_signals.iloc[i, df_signals.columns.get_loc('Take_Profit')] = entry_price + 5.0 * atr_value
```

#### Exit Conditions
The strategy exits an open position when ANY of the following conditions occur:

1. **RSI Overbought**: If RSI rises above 70, indicating the asset has become overbought.

2. **Stop-Loss Triggered**: If price falls below the calculated stop-loss level (Entry Price - ATR × Stop Multiplier).

3. **Take-Profit Triggered**: If price rises above the calculated take-profit level (Entry Price + ATR × Take Multiplier).

4. **Trend Reversal**: If price closes below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA50), suggesting the shorter-term trend may be reversing.

```python
# Exit logic from generate_signals() function
if df_signals.iloc[i]['Signal'] == 1 and df_signals.iloc[i]['RSI'] > 70:
    df_signals.iloc[i, df_signals.columns.get_loc('Signal')] = 0
    # Exit: RSI overbought
elif df_signals.iloc[i]['Signal'] == 1 and df_signals.iloc[i]['Low'] <= df_signals.iloc[i]['Stop_Loss']:
    df_signals.iloc[i, df_signals.columns.get_loc('Signal')] = 0
    # Exit: Stop-loss triggered
elif df_signals.iloc[i]['Signal'] == 1 and df_signals.iloc[i]['High'] >= df_signals.iloc[i]['Take_Profit']:
    df_signals.iloc[i, df_signals.columns.get_loc('Signal')] = 0
    # Exit: Take-profit triggered
elif df_signals.iloc[i]['Signal'] == 1 and df_signals.iloc[i]['Close'] < df_signals.iloc[i]['SMA50']:
    df_signals.iloc[i, df_signals.columns.get_loc('Signal')] = 0
    # Exit: Close below SMA50
```

#### Position Sizing and Risk Management
- **Fixed Risk Percentage**: Each trade risks 2% of the portfolio value (`Position_Size = 0.02`)
- **Dynamic Stop-Loss**: Calculated using ATR to adapt to market volatility (`Stop_Loss = Entry_Price - ATR × Stop_Multiplier`)
- **Asymmetric Reward-Risk Ratio**: Take-profit level is set at a multiple of the stop-loss distance (optimal parameters found: 2.0× ATR for stop-loss, 5.0× ATR for take-profit, resulting in a 2.5:1 reward-to-risk ratio)

#### Parameter Optimization Process
The strategy employs grid-search optimization across three key parameters:
- **RSI Threshold**: Tested values of 30, 35, 40, and 45
- **ATR Stop Multiplier**: Tested values of 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0
- **ATR Take Multiplier**: Tested values of 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0

Each parameter combination is evaluated based on:
- Sharpe Ratio (primary optimization metric)
- Total Return
- Maximum Drawdown
- Win Rate
- Number of Trades

The optimal parameter combination (RSI=35, Stop=2.0×ATR, Take=5.0×ATR) was selected based on maximizing the Sharpe Ratio, which balances return against risk.
