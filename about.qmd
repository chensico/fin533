## About the Project

This project explores the classic "Buy Low / Sell High" strategy with modern technical indicators to enhance decision-making and optimize trading performance. The goal is to develop a systematic approach to identify ideal entry and exit points while implementing effective risk management techniques.

Our optimization includes:

- Integration of multiple technical indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands)
- Dynamic position sizing based on market volatility
- Multi-layered stop loss implementation
- Backtesting against historical data
